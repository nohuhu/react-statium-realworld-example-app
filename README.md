# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### React + Statium real world example
(CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the
[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


## Getting started

(Live demo is coming shortly)

To get the front end app running locally:

* Clone this repository
* Run `yarn install`
* Run `yarn start`

The local development web server will use port 4884 to avoid collisions with other dev environments possibly running on localhost.
